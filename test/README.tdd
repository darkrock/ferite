To add a new test file:

1. Create the new file, say, foo-test.c
2. Edit MakefileTest.am.stub and add this entry:

	TEST: foo-test.c

3. Run bootstrap.sh to update MakefileTest.am:

	$ ./bootstrap.sh

4. Finally run make check. This will compile the new test and run it with all
   the existing tests:

	$ make check
